# Welcome to the Little-Collection!

Here are some little collections.

This is just the collection folder that Duke369rose considers valuable for collection or interesting to play with.

**If you are not sure about the purpose of a certain piece of code, please do not run it. Otherwise, it might cause damage to your computer.Since this repository is open-source, there might be some malicious code. Please be cautious when identifying it! Duke369 also conducts regular checks.**

Normally, each piece of code should have its own explanatory file, named "README-" followed by the name of the code file.

If a code does not have an explanation file, then it is very likely to be malicious code. However, it could also be that no explanation file is required (for example, the operation is too simple, etc.) or the instructions on how to use it have already been written in the code file.

**Duke369rose does not guarantee that all the content is legal. Therefore, before using it, please confirm that it complies with the local laws and regulations of your country.**

### It is public, and anyone who wants to help it become more perfect and better can participate.

**If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Duke369rose.**
